			<h2>&mdash; 04 January, 2017</h2>
			<p>In <a href="../../2016/12/hello-world.html">last week's episode of Dragon Ball Z</a>, we went over the basics of how the static site generator for this blog is set up. Since then, I've updated it to generate an <a href="../../feed.xml">Atom feed</a> for the site using the wonderful Python library <a href="https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen">feedgen</a>. Took about 10 new lines of code and 15 minutes altogether including setup.</p>
<h3>Atom Feed?</h3>
<p>Atom is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication">syndication</a> format spec which expands greatly on previously implemented standards (such as RSS). For those who don't want to read that monster of a Wikipedia article, a syndication file in the context of a blog is simply a file containing basic metadata about the website and the posts on the site. It provides a quick way for dedicated blog readers to aggregate post information about a number of different sites, provided these sites all have a syndication file. There are a number of different standards for what this syndication file should look like, most notable RSS and Atom. Atom's <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">RFC</a> was first published in 2005 and 12 years later has finally reached a point where it's well supported enough to be usable by most people, so it was the format chosen for this site.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>There isn't much to using feedgen, since most of the code is simply declarative. There are of course many properties that I haven't bothered to set (such as a recommended time to check for updates, <em>yikes</em>...), but I'm pretty sure I covered all of the important ones.</p>
<pre><code># blog properties
fg = FeedGenerator()
fg.title("Kid Contact's Blog")
fg.id('http://blog.kidcontact.org')
fg.subtitle('Broadcasting obscure and eclectic crap to the masses')
fg.author({'name': 'Stephan Lensky', 'email': 'stephanl.public@gmail.com'})
fg.link({'href': 'http://blog.kidcontact.org'})
fg.language('en')
fg.updated(datetime.now(pytz.timezone('America/New_York')).isoformat())

# properties for each post
for p in posts:
    url = 'http://blog.kidcontact.org/{}/{}/{}.html'
        .format(p['date'].year, p['date'].month, sanitized_name)
    fe = fg.add_entry()
    fe.id(url)
    fe.title(p['name'])
    fe.updated(pytz.timezone('America/New_York')
        .localize(p['modified']).isoformat())
    fe.link({'href': url})

# create files
fg.atom_file(str(BUILD_DIR) + '/feed.xml')
fg.rss_file(str(BUILD_DIR) + '/rss.xml')
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, feedgen makes it rather easy to generate both Atom and RSS feeds. Atom is honestly just a better format, but for your convenience RSS is also available <a href="../../rss.xml">here</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>kidcontact</p>
