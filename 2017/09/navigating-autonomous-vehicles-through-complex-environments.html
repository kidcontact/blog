			<h1><a href="#">Navigating Autonomous Vehicles Through Complex Environments</a></h1>
			<h2>&mdash; 09 September, 2017</h2>
			<p><em>This post was adapted from the final report I wrote at the conclusion of the month-long MIT BeaverWorks summer program. This program centered on autonomous systems, and the course I selected involved programming modified remote controlled cars to navigate a complex racetrack. Our team finished in first place in both the individual time trial portion of the final event and the full 12 car Grand Prix.</em></p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p><em>This project attempted to come up with an efficient method of programming autonomous remote-control rally cars to move and advance through a changing obstacle course. Challenges in this obstacle course included tight turns in a track bounded by cardboard walls, crossing over and under a bridge, and following a brightly colored portion of the track with no walls. Success was evaluated through individual time taken to complete the course and in a large 12-car race. Penalties were given for crashing into walls, veering off the defined track, or hitting other cars in the multi-car race. Although the project used one tenth scale cars, many of the concepts applied and safety features implemented throughout this project are equally applicable to modern self-driving vehicle technology.</em></p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) is a subdivision of the Beaver Works program jointly chartered by the MIT School of Engineering and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The Beaver Works program focuses on making innovative project-based learning available to students, and students at Beaver Works often make valuable contributions to a variety of pressing real-world global problems. BWSI brings the same project-based learning techniques to high schoolers through a four-week STEM summer program. It celebrated its inaugural year in 2016, and has since had one additional session running from July-August in 2017. It offers high school students a unique opportunity to work with cutting edge technology that would otherwise be closed off to them, develops teamwork and communication skills, and promotes critical thinking and problem solving.</p>
<p>During its first year, BWSI offered a single program: Autonomous RACECAR Grand Prix. This program focused on developing software to autonomously navigate MITâ€™s RACECAR platform through a complex course with a variety of different challenges, including tight turns, obstacles, and other cars. Students employed a variety of techniques to accomplish this, including wall following, artificial potential fields, and visual servoing.</p>
